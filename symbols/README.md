# Symbols

The Symbol method returns a value/ID of type symbol (the 7th JS type, the data type symbol is a primitive data type).  Each symbol value returned from Symbol() is unique.  A symbol value may be used as an identifier for object properties; this is the data type's only purpose.

The data type "symbol" is a primitive data type having the quality that, values of this type can be used to make object properties that are anonymous. This data type is used as the key for an object property when the property is intended to be private, for the internal use of a class or an object type. For example, keys of type symbol exist in various built-in JavaScript objects.
